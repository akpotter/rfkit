Python tools to inspect .pm3 files produced by Proxmark3's. These
tools now support decoding and cloning HID proximity cards.

clone_hid.py: Copy an HID Prox II card, by producing commands
that you can write directly into an AGC reader. Pass the digits
on the back of the card as the first argument. Haven't figured
out the even/odd parity bit calculations yet, so you might have
to hardcode them manually in (hid.py)

decode_hid.py: Decode raw pm3 files, and produce png files of
waveforms for illustration purposes. Depending on the quality of
the signal, you might need to adjust the noise filter logic. I 
haven't yet figured out a formula that works in all cases. Pass
.pm3 filename as first argument.
